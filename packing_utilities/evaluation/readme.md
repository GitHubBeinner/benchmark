# Explanation

## Directories:
- inputs: test data.
- outputs: output data that contains pareto solutions.
- simulation: 3D simulation of the pareto solutions.
- boundary.txt: the boundary values of pareto solutions of each instance.

## Evaluation Metric

The detail could be found in https://www.noahlab.com.hk/logistics-ranking/#/competition_details

The maximum and minimum values of the objective function f<sub>1</sub><sup>min</sup>, f<sub>1</sub><sup>max</sup>, f<sub>2</sub><sup>min</sup> and f<sub>2</sub><sup>max</sup> of each instance are provided in boundary.txt. Please note that if an instance have the sole pareto solution, the minimum values, f<sub>1</sub><sup>min</sup> and f<sub>2</sub><sup>min</sup>, are set to 0.
